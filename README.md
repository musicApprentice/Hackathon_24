Dependencies: 
pip install music21

How to run:
python getRotations.py - This will run the program on the Chopin excerpt by default
python .\getRotations.py demo_scores\J.S._Bach_Invention_No._4_in_D_Minor.musicxml  - Enter the file path you want to run the program on

Note: The correctness of the script depends on all of your fingerings being filled in. Furthermore the script only works on RIGHT HAND passsages only right now and do not take chords into account.
